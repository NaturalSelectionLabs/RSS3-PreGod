> RSS3 is a next-generation feed standard that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution.

[![RSS3](https://badge.rss3.workers.dev/?version=v0.4.0)](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3/blob/main/versions/v0.4.0)

## Introduction

**ðŸš§ The project is under development and the first version is expected to be released in March or April 2022.**

We've seen the Web1 era when everyone was happy to use RSS as a standard format for syndication and the Web2 era when RSS declined and the closure of information between platforms are created.

We all agree that information should be more freely distributed in the Web3 era, and to facilitate this we need a common format that we can all use to syndicate information, reducing the cost of use and development. So we created a new protocol RSS3, RSS stands for a tribute to the history and 3 stands for Web3.

This is a close to decentralized [RSS3 Network](https://rss3.wiki/network-roadmap.html) implementation of [RSS3 protocol](https://rss3.wiki/protocol.html) v0.4.0 with full indexing function in Go.
